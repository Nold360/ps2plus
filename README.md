[Guide for developing with PS2SDK and Docker](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/how-to-develop-ps2-homebrew-using-docker-containers.29907/)

Build a Docker image with the PS2SDK toolchain:

```
docker build -t ps2plus .
```

Start a Docker container with the created Docker image. It binds the repository's folder to the `/project` 
path in the container and opens shell at that path.

```
docker run -it -w /project -v ${PWD}:/project ps2plus sh
```

Build the application:

```
make -C configurator
```

## Development
    
### Repository layout
    
### Platform porting

The firmware/bootloader's platform abstraction layer makes porting to new hardware relatively straightforward. New ports need modifications in the following locations:

- üë©‚Äçüíª **Platform code**. Create a new folder in the `firmware/src/platforms` directory. This should contain implementations of the platform abstraction functions defined in the `firmware/src/platforms/*.h` header files. Implementation files should be `#ifdef`-guarded using the `PLATFORM_<NAME>` definition (provided by the build system).

- üõ† **Platform/toolchain build configuration**:
    - **Toolchain configuration**. If the new platform uses a different toolchain than any existing platform, a new SCons toolchain has to be created for building. Create a new toolchain class in `site_scons/firmware/toolchains.py`. Its job is to set the correct C compiler/linker paths and flags so that the firmware source files can be properly built.

    - **Platform configuration**. Create a new platform class in `site_scons/firmware/platforms.py`. Its job is to select the correct toolchain, and to set the correct C compiler/linker flags to differentiate between the `bootloader` and `firmware` targets (the bootloader and firmware occupy different spaces in program memory). The platform class can also generate platform-specific IDE project files if desired. Include a new instance of this class in the `ALL_PLATFORMS` list.

- üê≥ **Docker-based continuous integration**:
    - **Docker toolchain image**. If the new platform uses a different toolchain than any existing platform, a new Docker image has to be created for building. Create a new `<toolchain>.Dockerfile` file in the `docker/` directory; this image should have the following installed:
        - Platform toolchain
        - `python3` and `python3-pip` (required for the build system and tools)
        - `scons` (via `pip3`; required for the build system)

    - **Docker Compose platform command**. Add the new platform to `docker/docker-compose.yml` as a new service named `firmware-<PLATFORM>` (must be all lowercase). If the platform also uses a new toolchain, add the toolchain to this same file in the `x-toolchains` section. **(TBD: Add a command that specifies to SCons which platform will be built.)**

    - **GitHub CI platform build**. The new platform has to be integrated into this repository's GitHub Workflows-based continuous integration building. **(TBD: This CI step should probably be refactored as a local GitHub Action that takes a list of platform names as inputs.)**
